# Customer Segmentation using Clustering (Machine Learning)

## Introduction

Customer segmentation is the process of dividing a large customer base into smaller groups based on similar characteristics or behaviors, such as demographics, psychographics, purchase history, or engagement with the brand. The goal of customer segmentation is to create distinct groups of customers with unique needs, preferences, and behaviors, and to develop targeted marketing strategies to better serve each group.

## Uses

Customer segmentation is a powerful tool for businesses looking to improve their marketing effectiveness, increase customer satisfaction and loyalty, and drive profitability. By understanding the unique needs and behaviors of different customer segments, businesses can create tailored marketing strategies that resonate with each group and drive long-term success.

## Project Overview

This project focuses on using machine learning techniques, specifically clustering algorithms, to perform customer segmentation. The dataset used typically contains various customer attributes such as demographics, purchase history, and engagement metrics. By applying clustering algorithms such as K-means, DBSCAN, or hierarchical clustering, we aim to identify distinct customer segments within the dataset.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**: Clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/customer-segmentation.git
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**: Make sure you have the necessary Python libraries installed. You can install them using pip:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Explore the Dataset**: Take a look at the dataset provided and understand the different attributes available for segmentation.

4. **Run the Notebook**: Open the Jupyter notebook `customer_segmentation.ipynb` and follow along with the analysis. Experiment with different clustering algorithms and parameters to identify meaningful customer segments.

5. **Evaluate Results**: Evaluate the results of the clustering analysis and interpret the identified customer segments. Determine actionable insights and strategies based on the segmentation.
